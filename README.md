   git clone https://github.com/aburaihan-dev/jenkins-in-docker.git
   cd jenkins-docker-setup

   ```
2. Build the Jenkins Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t jenkins-docker .
   ```
4. Start Jenkins using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
6. Access Jenkins in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8080. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.
